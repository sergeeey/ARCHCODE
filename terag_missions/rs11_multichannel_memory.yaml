    phase_transition: |
      The ARCHCODE RS-11 scan identified a transition between drift and stable memory regimes
      at bookmarking ~{bookmark_threshold} with epigenetic_strength ~{epi_strength}.
      This is consistent/inconsistent with prior RS-10 predictions.
      The multichannel memory model shows that epigenetic memory can partially compensate
      for low bookmarking, shifting the critical threshold.
