## Version 1: Technical (Nature Genetics / Genome Biology)

**Processivity of loop extrusion determines TAD boundary stability through a universal phase transition**

The three-dimensional architecture of the genome is organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) separated by boundary regions. While the molecular mechanisms of TAD formation through loop extrusion are well understood, the quantitative principles governing boundary stability remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that **processivity of loop extrusion**—defined as the product of extrusion rate (NIPBL velocity) and cohesin lifetime (WAPL lifetime)—serves as a **universal parameter** determining TAD boundary stability. Through systematic simulations across parameter space, we identify three distinct phases: unstable (processivity < 0.5), transitional (0.5–1.0), and stable (≥ 1.0). We validate this model by simulating Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), where NIPBL haploinsufficiency reduces processivity to 0.5, and WAPL overactivation scenarios, where reduced cohesin lifetime similarly destabilizes boundaries. Our results reveal that **different molecular defects converge on the same processivity axis**, providing a unified framework for understanding architectural instability in disease. This quantitative model enables prediction of boundary stability, identification of critical thresholds, and design of therapeutic strategies targeting processivity.

## Version 2: Accessible (Cell Systems / eLife)

**A universal parameter controls TAD boundary stability: processivity of loop extrusion**

Genome architecture is organized into domains (TADs) separated by boundaries, but what determines whether these boundaries are stable or unstable? We show that a single parameter—**processivity**—controls boundary stability. Processivity combines how fast loops grow (NIPBL velocity) and how long they last (WAPL lifetime). Through systematic simulations, we find three architectural phases: unstable boundaries at low processivity (< 0.5), transitional at medium (0.5–1.0), and stable at high (≥ 1.0). We test this model using Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), where reduced NIPBL lowers processivity to 0.5, causing boundary blurring. Similarly, WAPL overactivation reduces processivity and destabilizes boundaries. **Different molecular defects produce similar effects through the same processivity mechanism**, enabling unified prediction of architectural stability. Our quantitative model identifies critical thresholds and suggests therapeutic strategies: compensate for reduced NIPBL by increasing WAPL to restore processivity and stabilize boundaries.

## Version 3: Lay Summary (For Press Release)

**Scientists discover "power meter" for DNA organization**

Researchers have found that the stability of DNA organization—how well our genome is structured—depends on a single number called "processivity." Think of it as a power meter: when processivity is high, DNA is well-organized; when it's low, organization breaks down. The study shows that different diseases affecting different molecules actually work through the same mechanism—processivity. For example, Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) occurs when one protein (NIPBL) works too slowly, reducing processivity and blurring DNA boundaries. The model enables prediction of when DNA organization will fail and suggests new therapeutic strategies: compensate for slow NIPBL by boosting another protein (WAPL) to restore processivity. This discovery provides a unified framework for understanding and treating diseases caused by disrupted genome architecture.
