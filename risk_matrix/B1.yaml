# Risk B1: Boundary Stability Determinism

risk_id: B1
category: Biological Logic
uncertainty: 0.7
impact_on_model: 0.8
priority: 0.56

description: >
  Unknown mechanism of boundary stability determinism vs stochasticity.
  
  Some TAD boundaries are stable (>90% cell-to-cell reproducibility),
  others are variable (<50%). Difference not explained by CTCF strength alone.
  
  Factors affecting stability:
  - CTCF strength (known, but insufficient)
  - Energy landscape (non-B DNA barriers)
  - Epigenetic context (methylation, histones)
  - TE motifs (stabilization/destruction)
  - Temporal dynamics (order of events)

affected_modules:
  - archcode_core
  - nonB_logic
  - epigenetic_compiler
  - te_grammar
  - boundary_stability (new module)

mitigation_strategy:
  - "Build multiplicative stability model"
  - "Integrate factors from all ARCHCODE modules"
  - "Calibrate thresholds from experimental data"
  - "Create boundary_stability_predictor module"
