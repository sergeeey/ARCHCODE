# Risk P2: Extrusion Asymmetry

risk_id: P2
category: Physical
uncertainty: 0.7
impact_on_model: 0.6
priority: 0.42

description: >
  Unknown asymmetry of loop extrusion (one-sided vs symmetric).

affected_modules:
  - archcode_core

mitigation_strategy:
  - "Parameterize extrusion_mode in config"
  - "Allow both symmetric and asymmetric modes"
  - "Compare simulation outputs"
