# Risk L1: B → Z-DNA Transition Threshold

risk_id: L1
category: Logic
uncertainty: 0.7
impact_on_model: 0.5
priority: 0.35

description: >
  Unknown threshold for B → Z-DNA transition (torque/energy).
  
  Z-DNA formation is CONTROLLED by:
  - Sequence preference (GC repeats, alternating purine-pyrimidine)
  - Negative supercoiling (torque < threshold)
  - Transcription (creates negative supercoiling)
  - Ionic conditions (high salt stabilizes)
  
  Current model implements controlled logic, but exact threshold needs calibration.

affected_modules:
  - nonB_logic

mitigation_strategy:
  - "Parameterize threshold in config"
  - "Use literature values as defaults"
  - "Allow experimental calibration"
