# Engineering Unknown: Why is loop extrusion asymmetric?

description: >
  Loop extrusion exhibits asymmetric behavior:
  - One-sided extrusion (cohesin moves in one direction)
  - Asymmetric barriers (CTCF blocks one direction)
  - Directional bias in TAD formation
  
  Unknown mechanism:
  - What determines extrusion direction?
  - How does NIPBL loading site affect asymmetry?
  - Role of transcription direction?
