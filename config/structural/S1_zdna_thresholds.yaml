  Z-DNA UPDATE v1.1:
  - Precise thermodynamic threshold: σ ≤ -0.06
  - Sequence sensors: (dC-dG)n repeats
  - Effect: "Torsion Absorber" - relieves strain, potentially stalling extrusion
  
  Implications:
  - Can be integrated into Boundary Stability Predictor
  - Models loop stall at Z-DNA sites
  - Explains boundary formation at supercoiled regions
