z_dna_parameters:
  # Engineering Unknown L1: B → Z-DNA transition threshold (v1.1 UPDATE)
  # Z-DNA formation is CONTROLLED by sequence + torque + transcription

  transition_threshold: -0.06      # Alias for critical_sigma (backward compatibility)
  
  # Torque threshold: negative supercoiling promotes Z-DNA
